# Plant-LEAF-NOW-
**Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter clean air, provide fresh drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for thousands of species of plants and animals.
Planting a billion trees can help save the Earth from climate change and biodiversity loss. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon and support biodiversity. A billion is a big number, but we know we can do it together. Help plant trees today!

Basically this website provides  you a platform where you can sell you plants also with the profit margin you can donate the plants for the forest conservation and a chance to make the earth better place for living .
